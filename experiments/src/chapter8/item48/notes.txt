Avoid float and double if exact answers are required

- Merely rounding prior to printing does not always do the job.

- The right way is to use BigDecimal, int, or long for monetary calculations. BigDecimal
has methods to handle operations and for comparisons. Using int or long you can keep
track of the decimal (cents) manually and convert as needed.

- BigDecimal has eight rounding modes and can be used in a business context.

- If the problem requires
    * 9 decimal digits -> use int
    * 18 decimal digits -> use long
    * 19 and more decimal digits -> use BigDecimal
