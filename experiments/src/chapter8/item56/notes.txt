Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions

- Naming conventions typically fall into the categories: typographical and grammatical

- Type parameter names usually consist of a single letter
    * T -> an arbitrary type
    * E -> an element type of a collection
    * K/V -> key and value types for a map
    * X -> an exception

- For grammatical conventions there are less defined
    * Class and Enum -> singular noun or noun phrase
    * Interface -> same as Class or with an adjective followed by "able" or "ible"
    * Methods ->
        - performed action -> verb or verb phrase
        - return boolean -> "is" or "has" prefix followed by noun/noun phrase
        - return non-boolean or attribute -> more flexible, "get" a typical prefix
        - return converted type -> "to" prefix and then type
        - return a view with different type -> "as" prefix and then type
