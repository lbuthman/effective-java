Prefer for-each loops to traditional for loops

- To take advantage of the new for-each loop, the class needs to implement Iterable.

- The traditional loop is no longer preferred.

- There are three common situations where you can't use it though.
    1) Filtering -> if you need to traverse a collection and remove elements, must use an
    explicit iterator.
    2) Transforming -> if you need to traverse a collection and replace some or all of the
    values, you need to list iterator or array index to set the value.
    3) Parallel Iteration -> if multiple collections need to be traversed in parallel, then
    you need explicit control over the iterator or index variable
