Use native methods judiciously

- JNI -> Java Native Interface

- A "native method" allows code in other languages to execute code and then return to Java.

 - There are three typical uses for native methods
    1) to provide access to platform specific facilities
    2) to access libraries in legacy code thus accessing legacy data
    3) to write performance critical parts of the application for improved performance

- It is rarely advisable to use native methods to improve performance.
