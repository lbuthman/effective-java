Beware the performance of string concatenation

- Using the string concatenation operator repeatedly to concatenate a string requires
quadratic time in n. Since strings are immutable, the contents of both are copied.

- To achieve better performance, use a StringBuilder

- In the example, the StringBuilder may be "tuned" by allocating its size upfront. This had
a large impact on the algorithms performance.
