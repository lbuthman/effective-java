Refer to items by their interfaces

- If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, variables, and
fields should all be declared using interface types. The only time you really need to
refer to an object's class is when creating it with a constructor.

- This item first mentions "appropriate interface", so if it doesn't exist or isn't
appropriate, using a class is fine and even necessary.
