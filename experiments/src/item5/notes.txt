Avoid creating unnecessary objects

- An item can always be reused if it is immutable.

- By using the static factory method, we can return a new object or just pass
a reference to an already created one. Unlike a constructor, it does not have to
allocate a new object.

- Prefer primitives to boxed primitives. The example with Long vs. long showed
that the latter in a loop caused the creation of a new Long object on each
iteration. This drove the run time up considerably.
