Check parameters for validity

- Methods and constructors almost always have restrictions on the parameters they case use.
These should be enforced and documented.

- For public methods, use the @throws tag to document thrown errors, typically the exception
will be IllegalArgumentException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, or NullPointerException

- For "unexported" (non-public) methods, generally check parameters with assertions. These
will throw AssertionError if they fail and typically have no effect or cost.
