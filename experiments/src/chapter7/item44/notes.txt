Write doc comments for all exposed API elements

- See Sun's article: How to Write Doc Comments

- To document an API properly, precede every exported class, interface, constructor, method,
and field declaration with a doc comment

- The doc comment for a method should describe succinctly the contract between the method and
its clients.
