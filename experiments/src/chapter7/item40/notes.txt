Design method signatures carefully

- Choose names carefully
- Don't go overboard in providing convenience methods. When in doubt, leave it out.
- Avoid long parameter lists, especially long sequences of identically type parameters.
- For parameter types, favor interfaces over classes.
- Prefer two element enum types to boolean parameters.
