Use overloading judiciously

- Avoid confusing uses of overloaded methods.

- A safe, conservative policy is never to export two overloaded methods with the same
number of parameters.

- For constructors, exporting multiple overloadings with the same number of parameters is
unlikely to cause confusion if it is always clear which overloading will apply to a given
set of parameters.
