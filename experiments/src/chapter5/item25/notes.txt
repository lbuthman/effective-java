Prefer lists to arrays

- Because arrays are "covariant", a type mismatch is not detected until runtime. Generics on the
other hand are "invariant" and can catch the mismatch at compile time.

- Arrays are also "reified", enforcing their elements at runtime. Generics however are implemented
by "erasure" which is caught at compile time.

- Arrays cannot be generic so it is not generally possible for a generic type to return an array
of its elements. It also means confusing warnings can arise when using varags methods in combination
with generic types.
