Eliminate unchecked warnings

- When starting out with Generics, many warning will be generated; these will be reduced as
experience is gained using them.

- Eliminate every checked warning, even when it is difficult. The only caveat is after meticulously
verifying that the code is type safe and will compile correctly, only then can the @SuppressWarning
be used. Always suppress at the lowest scope. If the code being suppressed is more than a line or
two long, move the suppression to a local variable, even if a new one needs to be created.

- Every time the @SuppressWarning annotation is used provide a comment stating why it is safe to
use.
