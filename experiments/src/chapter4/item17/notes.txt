Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it

- The class must document precisely the effects of overriding any methods. A class must
document any circumstances under which it might invoke an overridable method.

- The only way to test a class designed for inheritance is to write subclasses. This is
optimally done by someone other than the class author.

- Constructors must not invoke overridable methods, directly or indirectly
