Favor static member classes over non-static

- There are four kinds of nested classes
    1) static member classes
    2) non-static member classes
    3) anonymous classes
    4) local classes

- One common use of a static member class is a public helper class, used exclusively by its
outer class.

- If a member class does not require access to its enclosing instance, always put the static
modifier in its declaration. Otherwise, extraneous references to the enclosing instance
will always exist.
