Use interfaces only to define types

- The "constant interface" consisting solely of static fields is a poor choice for an interface.
That a class uses some constants is an implementation detail, but this design causes the
implementation detail to leak into the API. In addition, it must be supported forever, even if
there is a need to refactor at some point in time. Make them part of the class, use an enum
type, or create a utility class.

- In the case of utility classes, referring to classes requires the class name to be qualified.
To avoid this, the import static statement can be used.

- Interfaces serve as a "type" used to refer to instances of a class. When a class implements an
interface, this should say something about what a client can do with instances of the class.
