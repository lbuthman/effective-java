Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes

- Tagged classes are classes the could implement more than one type of object, like either
square or circle. It's pretty obvious the deficiencies, being verbose, error-prone, inefficient.

- To properly implement a class hierarchy, first define an abstract class containing abstract
methods for each subclass. If there are any methods that do not depend on the flavor of an
implementation, put them in this class as normal methods. Same with common data fields. Next,
define subclasses with appropriate methods and fields
