Override clone judiciously

- The Clonable interface was intended to advertise that a class permits cloning. Buth
it fails to serve this purpose because it lacks a clone method and the one from Object
is protected. Yet, it is widely in use today so we must be aware and ready.

- The implementation of Clonable modifies the behavior of a protected method in the super
class, an atypical use for an interface.

- There are a lot of ins & outs and care must be taken, especially when cloning objects
that have arrays and/or references to other objects. For now, I will just HANDWAVE over
it.
