In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields

- If a class is accessible outside its package, provide accessor methods.

- However, if a class is package-private or is a private nested class, there is nothing
inherently wrong with exposing its data fields, assuming they do an adequate job of describing
the abstraction provided by the class.
