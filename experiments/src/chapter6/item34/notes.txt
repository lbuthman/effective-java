Emulate extensible Enums with interfaces

- In older times, there was no Enum type and one had to be rigged up which is now an inferior
implementation. The Enum type is not extensible, which is good because it can complicate
design and implementations. But there is a valid use case for extensible enumerated types,
which is the "opcode". It might be desirable to let a client programmer extend an API with
opcodes.

- This functionality can be achieved since enum types can implement arbitrary interfaces.

- When using interfaces to emulate extensible enums, code in the extending Enum might get
repeated. To avoid this, helper classes or static helper methods can be used.
