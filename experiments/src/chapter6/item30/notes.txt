Use enums instead of int constants

- The first talks about old ways of approaching int and string constants for types and their
drawbacks. Then talks about enums and their benefits as well as how they address the drawbacks
from before.

- Enums can start as simple collections of constants and turn into a fully featured abstraction.
Really cool example of a fully featured enum with required/recommended syntax.

- To associate behavior with an Enum type, declare an abstract method in the body and after
each type, override it with the desired functionality. There is also an example of overriding
the toString method.

- Enums are good for sets when all the values are known at compile time.
