Consider implementing Comparable

- compareTo() is the sole method in the Comparable interface. By implementing it, the
class implies it contains a natural ordering.

- By implementing Comparable, a class can interoperate with all of the many generic
algorithms and collection implementations that depend on this implementation. Think of
search, computing Extreme values, maintaining sorted collections, etc.

- The general contract is similar to equals, stating the need for reflexivity, symmetry,
and transitivity.

- Just like a class that violates the hashCode() contract, compareTo() can break other
classes that depend on comparisons.

- The depths of the general contract are a bit abstract for me at the moment so again
I will just HANDWAVE over it for now.
