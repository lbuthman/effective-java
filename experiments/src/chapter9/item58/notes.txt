Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors

- Unchecked throwable runtime exceptions and errors indicate that recovery is impossible
and continuing would do more harm than good. Runtime errors indicate programming errors.

- Checked exceptions are recoverable.

- The difference is not always apparent on which to use and requires consideration.

- Because checked exceptions are generally recoverable, it should provide a method that
furnishes information helpful to the caller so as to help it recover.
