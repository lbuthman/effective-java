Strive for failure atomicity

- In general, a failed method invocation should leave the object in the state it was in
prior to invocation. The simplest way to achieve this is with immutable objects.

- For mutable objects, check parameters before performing the operation.

- Order the method steps so that any part that may fail happens before the object is modified.

- Another approach is to copy the objects data into a temporary object and rollback to it
if needed.
