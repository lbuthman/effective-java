Use lazy initialization judiciously

- While lazy initialization decreases the cost of creating an instance, it increases the cost
of accessing the field.

- If a field is accessed only on a fraction of the instances of a class AND it is costly to
initialize, then it can be good. The only way to know is to measure performance.
