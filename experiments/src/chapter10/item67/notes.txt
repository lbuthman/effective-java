Avoid excess synchronization

- Inside a synchronized region, do not invoke a method that is designed to be overridden
or one provided by a client in the form of a function object.

- CopyOnWriteArrayList has poor performance but can be great for observer lists.

- As a rule, you should do as little work as possible inside a synchronized region.

- When in doubt, do not synchronize your class but document that it is not thread safe.

- If a method modifies a static field, you must synchronize access to this field.
