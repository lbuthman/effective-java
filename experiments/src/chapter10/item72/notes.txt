Don't depend on the thread scheduler

- Any program that relies on the thread scheduler for correctness or performance is unlikely
to be portable.

- Threads should not run if they aren't doing useful work.

- Thread.yield has no testable semantics and can't fix threads that aren't getting enough
CPU in a portable way.

- Thread priorities are amount the least portable features of the java platform.
