Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify

- Given the difficulty of using wait and notify correctly, use higher-level concurrency
utilities instead.

- java.util.concurrency falls into three categories
    1) Executor Framework
    2) concurrent collections
    3) synchronizers

- Use ConcurrentHashMap in preference to Collections.synchronizedMap or HashTable

- For interval timing, always use System.nanoTime over System.currentTimeMillis
