Write readObject defensively

- When an object is deserialized, it is critical to defensively copy any field containing an
object reference that a client must not possess.

- Do not use the writeUnshared or readUnshared methods.

- Anytime you write a readObject method, you are writing a public constructor that must provide
a valid instance regardless of what byte stream is given.
