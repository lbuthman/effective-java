Implement serializable judiciously

- Object serialization encodes objects as byte streams and reconstructs objects from encoding.

- While it is simple to implement Serializable, the long-term cost can be substantial.

- A major cost is it decreases the flexibility to change a class and implementation after it
has been released.

- Implementing default Serializable increases the likelihood of bugs and security holes

- It increases the testing burden associated with a new release.

- Classes designed for inheritance should rarely implement it and interfaces should rarely
extend it.

- Value classes should implement it.
