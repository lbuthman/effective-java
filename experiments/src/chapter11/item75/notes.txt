Consider using a customer serialized form

- Do not accept the default serialized form without first considering whether it is appropriate.
Once released, you will be very much tied to it.

- Only accept the default form if it is largely identical to the encoding you would choose.

- Using the default serialized form when an object's physical representation differs substantially
from its logical data content has four disadvantages.
    1) It permanently ties the exported API to the current internal representation.
    2) It consumes excessive space.
    3) It consumes excessive time.
    4) It can cause stack overflow

- The "transient" modifier indicates the instance field is to be omitted from a class's serialized
form.
