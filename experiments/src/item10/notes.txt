Always override toString()

- Providing a good toString makes a class pleasant to use.

- When practical, a good toString() will return all the interesting information contained
in the Object, being self-explanatory.

- Consider whether to specify the return format in the documentation. This can be important
for value classes. The disadvantage to specifying it is that once it is specified, you are
stuck with it for life. Either way, document the intent clearly. If the format is not specified,
provide programmatic access to all information contianed in the value returned by toString().
